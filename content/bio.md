Here is a brief biography suitable for use in brochures, advertisements, media,
etc. The image on this page should be of sufficient resolution for small
printing. Contact me via [keybase {{<fa key>}}](https://keybase.io/samh) 
or [e-mail {{<fa envelope>}}](/email/) for a **.pdf** of my CV/resume.

**Sam Havron is a PhD student in computer science at Cornell University; he is
in residence at Cornell Tech in New York City. 
Sam's interests include research and production aspects of computer security &
privacy for mitigating intimate partner violence,
adversarial machine learning, applied cryptography, and password authentication systems.
When not staring at metal rectangles full of little lights, 
Sam can often be spotted reading books, or biking.**
