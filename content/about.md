<p>Outside of being a student, I like to spend my time
watching historical documentaries and playing <a
href="http://www.iambreadgame.com/" target="_blank"><i>games with intentionally
terrible controls</i></a>. I enjoy taking long outdoor runs, walking everywhere,
and listening to anything composed by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hisaishi" target="_blank">Joe
Hisaishi</a> and his contemporaries. I've also taken up blogging recently--<a
href="https://havron.xyz/blog/2016/welcome-and-meta-blogging">here's my first
post</a>.</p>

<h2 class="text-center">Odds and Ends...</h2>
<ul class="ul-interests fa-ul">
<li>
<i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
I am left-handed. For reasons uncertain, I tend to open doors with my right
hand.</li>

<li>
<i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
[Kingdom Hearts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts) is everything I could want 
from a videogame: a lengthy RPG with a nuanced storyline, fantastic soundtrack, 
and very thoughtful worldbuilding/character design. As a result of this, the 
[PlayStation 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2) is my
preferred gaming console, despite the shortcomings of its controller, and
general dated-ness.
</li>

<li> <i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> 
The best keyboard I've used (and continue to use regularly) is the [das 4
ultimate](http://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-ultimate/). It has no
etchings on any of the key caps, and sports Cherry MX Brown mechanical switches.
I've become a much better typist and programmer with das, and
I highly encourage all people everywhere to try out and use mechanical keyboards. :-) 
</li>

<li> <i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> 
After spending some time distro-hopping (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, Mint, 
Kubuntu, and others), I've settled on using [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org) 
as my primary OS, mainly due to its relative stability, minimal maintenance time, 
rich `pacman`/`yaourt` package management, and the wonderful
online user community. Linux Mint/Ubuntu are close seconds! 
Given the time, I'd like to explore more "pure" UNIX derivatives than 
[GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/), such as [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/). 
</li>


<li>
<i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
Of the desktop environments I've used, [KDE](https://www.kde.org/) has been the
most pleasing thus far (although I actually enjoy using the [Unity
desktop](http://unity.ubuntu.com/), so perhaps my metrics for a "good" 
desktop are unorthodox).
</li>

<li>
<i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
Eventually, I plan to build my own IoT paradise, using tools 
such as/similar to AWS Lambda functions/Raspberry Pis/Arduinos/Amazon Alexa
and so forth. Seeing as the "security" of most IoT backends is lacking, I hope
to learn safe practices when connecting my devices to any network (this definitely
includes routing all network traffic through a VPN at the very least).
</li>

<li>
<i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
I prefer to address a group as "you all" (or its oft misunderstood [Southern
Contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%27all)) rather than "hey guys".</li>

<li>
<i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
I was sorted into [Gryffindor
House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts#Gryffindor)
by [pottermore](https://www.pottermore.com/).
</li>

<li>
<i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
From a young age, my diet has been (and is still) entirely vegetarian--I
hold no nuanced or compelling argument as to why, though.</li>

<li>
<i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
I marched in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City with the 
[Cavalier Marching Band](http://www.cavaliermarchingband.com/) 
in 2015, as well as the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Chicago with the 
[John Handley Marching Judges Band](http://jhhs.wps.k12.va.us/band.html) in 2014.</li>

<li>
<i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
I have personally been a victim of [this crucial
design flaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TudFAEUkR9Y) (ask me about it).</li>
