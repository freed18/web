<h1>Teaching Assistant (TA)</h1>
As an undergraduate student, I have TA'd the following courses:

The majority of my time spent on each course is dedicated to answering student
questions during office hours and through an <a href="https://piazza.com"

sessions for students. I occasionally grade quizzes and exams.

<h1>Advising and Judging</h1>
I am a Resident Advisor for first-year students under the
<a href="http://www.virginia.edu/housing/" target="_blank">Housing &amp;
Residence Life</a> office at the 
<a href="http://www.virginia.edu" target="_blank">University of Virginia</a>,
serving in the following associations:
<ul class="ul-interests fa-ul">
<li>
<i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
Woody-Cauthen Association (2015-2016 Academic Year)</li>
<li>
<i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
Woody-Cauthen Association, Redux! (2016-2017 Academic Year)</li>
</ul>

I am also a judge for <a href="http://acm.cs.virginia.edu/index.php"
target="_blank">ACM@UVA</a>'s
annual <a href="http://acm.cs.virginia.edu/hspc.php" target="_blank">High School
Programming Contest (HSPC)</a>, the largest HSPC in the mid-Atlantic region, and
one of the largest in the United States.
I have also served as a judge for high school psychology research papers in the
<a href="http://www.vjas.org/2016-symposium.html" target="_blank">Virginia
Junior Academy of Science's Annual Research Symposium</a>.

Lastly, I am the computing majors committee chair for <a
href="http://daedalusatuva.wixsite.com/home"
target="_blank">DAEDALUS@UVA</a>, a project which hosts interactive seminars on
the fundamental ideas of each major offered within <a
href="http://seas.virginia.edu/" target="_blank">SEAS</a>. 
It is intended for first year engineering students who are interested in
learning more about the different majors offered at UVA, and is integrated into
the curriculum of the <a
href="http://rabi.phys.virginia.edu/mySIS/CC2/ENGR.html"
target="_blank">Introduction to Engineering (ENGR 1620)</a> course.
