 I am currently working as an undergraduate researcher advised by
 [UVA](http://www.virginia.edu/) [Computer
 Science](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/) Professor [David
 Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans) in the university's [computer security research
 group](http://www.jeffersonswheel.org/). 
 My main research interests lie in computer security and privacy problems, 
 though I am also intrigued by areas in programming languages, 
 human-computer interaction, applied cryptography, and usable security.

 As part of my undergraduate
 thesis, I am creating a
 password manager which mitigates several vulnerabilities found in modern
 commercial password managers, such as in cloud-storage database leaks and
 password autofill XSS/CSRF attacks. A link to its {{<fa github>}} GitHub repository will be added in
 December 2016.

  In the Spring 2017 semester, I will be taking a graduate CS course titled *Understanding
 and Securing TLS*, in which "[students will] take a deep dive into understanding how TLS came
 to be the mess it is, look into some of the vulnerabilities in detail, and
 study methods for making TLS more secure." We will be contributing
 significantly to an open-source implementation of TLS using the 
 [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language (with the hopes that it
 could become a viable replacement for `openssl`).

  Since its launch on 28 October 2016, [ZCash](https://z.cash) has garnered [much
 interest](https://z.cash/buzz.html) amongst cryptographers and advocates of
 a truly privacy-preserving decentralized cryptocurrency. 
 As part of a course project in cryptography, I will be giving a talk on
 the construction of zk-SNARKs (non-interactive zero knowledge proofs) and the
 Zerocash protocol, particularly in regards to their ZCash implementation and
 Ethereum applications. 
 The talk will be accompanied by a white paper, which will include 
 future feature suggestions/constructions for ZCash in regards to Ethereum 
 (a link to the paper will be added in December 2016).
