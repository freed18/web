# Welcome
Hiya, thanks for connecting over [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)! Right now, I am probably practicing the art of
expressing formal injunctions or [spewing cringeworthy quotes](https://quotes.cs.cornell.edu/).
I am an apprentice of [Tom Ristenpart](https://rist.tech.cornell.edu) and
[Nicki Dell](http://nixdell.com); under their guidance, I'm learning how to become an
effective researcher and a strong advocate for socio-technical progress.
