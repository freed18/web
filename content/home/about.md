# Welcome

Hi, I'm Sam Havron! I'm a computer science undergraduate and proud [Resident
Advisor](http://www.virginia.edu/housing/programs.php?id=ra) of 22 first-year
students at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/). I am an
active member of the [Mountain View Parish](http://www.mvplutherans.org/) and
aspire to learn and practice my faith in God as a Lutheran every day.

You're welcome to browse around at your leisure, and [get in touch with
me](/about) if you'd like to chat! ([PGP {{<fa
key>}} available if preferred](https://keybase.io/samh)). 
For [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)-averse folks: 
browsing with `cURL`/Lynx/RSS feed/etc is doable, though perhaps you would be better off 
searching the site's 
[{{<fa github>}} GitHub repository](https://github.com/samuelhavron/hogsmeade) directly.
