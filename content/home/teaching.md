Currently, I am a teaching assistant (TA) for the following courses 
at the University of Virginia:

<ul class="ul-interests fa-ul">
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>CS 4501: [{{<fa github>}} Internet Scale
Applications](https://github.com/thomaspinckney3/cs4501/) (1 semester: Spring
2017). A course on scalable web/mobile apps, with a focus on DevOps and cloud
infrastructure. Students build a comprehensive marketplace, 
leveraging technologies including [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), 
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/),
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/), [redis](http://redis.io/),
[HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/),
[mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [Apache
JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/index.html),
[Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/),
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [git](https://git-scm.com/),
[GitHub](https://github.com/), [slack](https://slack.com/), and [Apache
Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).</li>

<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
CS 2150: [{{<fa github>}} Program and Data
Representation](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr) (3 semesters: Spring
2016, Fall 2016, Spring 2017). A data structures course with a focus on
understanding program and data representation at high levels (OO design, C++) and low
levels (C, x86\_64, machine code) in the context of queues, stacks, hashing,
linked-lists, graphs, trees, and their $\mathcal{O},\Theta,\Omega$ space-time complexities. The course introduces (and 
requires usage of) `bash` and text-editors such as `emacs` or `vi`.</li>

<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
ECE 2330: Digital Logic Design (4 semesters: Fall 2015, Spring 2016, Fall
2016, Spring 2017). A digital logic course with a focus on network design.
Includes number systems and conversion, boolean algebra and logic
gates, minimization of switching functions, combinational network design,
flip-flops, mealy and moore machines, sequential network design, and
arithmetic networks; the course culminates in building a six-instruction
processor using RTL design principles.
