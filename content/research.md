<h1>Mentors</h1>
It takes an entire department to raise a student. 
I'm eternally grateful to my mentors, 
formal and informal, who have given me immeasurable help and able guidance
in my research and in my general life. I would not be where 
I am today without these wonderful people.

[Professor Tom Ristenpart](https://rist.tech.cornell.edu) 
 and [Professor Nicki Dell](http://nixdell.com) advise me as a grad student (currently informally). 
[Professor Dave
 Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans) advised me as an undergrad (formally).
 
# Interests
My research interests include topics in computer security & privacy, programming
languages, applied cryptography, machine learning, and interdisciplinary efforts
among these areas. Recently, this has included building systems that preserve
the privacy and safety of end-users while also increasing transparency and
responsibility of providers -- including in automated decision-making systems
and relevant machine learning models. I am especially interested in research
opportunities that result in direct positive impact on marginalized
communities, such as victims of intimate partner violence.

Some topics I've explored in depth include those listed in [Cornell CS
6431: Security & Privacy
Technologies](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shmat/courses/cs6431/index.html).
