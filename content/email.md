# "Easier to Remember" address
`havron@cs.cornell.edu`

**The mail forwarding service powering this
address is unwieldy**:
usually it takes a minute or so for me to get e-mails sent here, 
and in the worst case, I do not get e-mails for 
_an hour or more_ after the initial timestamp! Yikes!

# "Faster Delivery" address
`sgh65@cornell.edu`

**I will get your message instantaneously** if you send it to this perhaps "less-memorable" address; 
it's my initials concatenated with the year my university (1865) or CS department (1965) was founded, modulo 100.
