# "Easier to Remember" address
You can address me by my [_lastname_](/) at my [department domain](https://ddg.gg/cornell%20computer%20science) for 
standard e-mail.

However, <span style="color:#B31B1B">**the mail forwarding service powering this address is rather
slow**</span>:
usually it takes a couple minutes for me to get emails sent here, 
and in the worst case, I do not get emails for 
_up to an hour or more_ after the initial timestamp! Yikes!

# "Faster Delivery" address
<span style="color: #B31B1B">**I will get your message instantaneously**</span> if you send it 
to [the address found on my university directory entry](https://www.cornell.edu/search/people.cfm?q=havron).

If you are averse to invoking hyperlinks (or just enjoy practicing logic), you may 
construct my "faster delivery" email using the following steps:

1. start with [my initials](/)
2. append the year [my university](https://www.cornell.edu/about/facts.cfm) ([and/or department](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/about)) was founded, [modulo 100](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=1965+modulo+100&ia=calculator)
3. 'at' [my university domain](https://ddg.gg/cornell%20university)
