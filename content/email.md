# _Use any of these to contact me! Totally up to you._
# Personal addresses
## sam@havron.xyz

## s@m.havron.xyz ([domain hack](http://xona.com/2004/11/03.html))


# "Easier to Remember" academic address
## havron@cs.cornell.edu

**The mail forwarding service powering this
address is unwieldy**:
usually it takes a minute or so for me to get e-mails sent here, 
and in the worst case, I do not get e-mails for 
_an hour or more_ after the initial timestamp! Yikes!

## "Faster Delivery" academic address
## sgh65@cornell.edu

**I will get your message instantaneously** if you send it to this perhaps "less-memorable" address; 
it's my initials concatenated with the year my university (1865) or CS
department (1965) was founded, modulo 100.

## Nota Bene: The E-mail Obfuscation Game
### Should you play the game?
My addresses are easily harvested; for now,
I allow this because I want to build a better understanding of the detriments
 of obfuscation strategies to user-friendliness (including 
[JS environment assumptions](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/26179/why-do-people-disable-javascript)) 
before committing to deploying one.
The ultimate necessity of obfuscation is also [unclear to
me](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/dec/21/keeping-email-address-secret-spambots).

Most harvesters use sophisticated regex (and in the
case of addresses embedded in images, OCR)
techniques to reconstruct e-mail addresses. More aggressive adversaries might
**simply hire humans on Amazon's Mechanical Turk as harvesters**, which breaks virtually all obfuscation strategies!

If you are planning on adopting an obfuscation strategy of your own, please first consider 
interesting [honeypot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot\_(computing)) experiments you could run through posting
targeted aliases of your e-mail address publicly...

### More Optimal Obfuscation Strategies
For anyone interested in playing the e-mail obfuscation game, 
there's a [myriad of
strategies](https://superuser.com/questions/235937/does-e-mail-address-obfuscation-actually-work)
 that often trade user-friendliness for 
stronger obfuscation guarantees (e.g. e-mail addresses hidden behind Google CAPTCHAs seem pretty robust).

Short of directly inviting people to contact me, I have not 
come up with a reliable and user-friendly obfuscation strategy 
to protect myself from the inevitable crowd-source-powered (human) harvesters. 
My strategy would likely entail a written description of how to construct my address,
described in a way that is sufficiently difficult for state-of-the-art NLP techniques to solve,
and such that there is a way for the construction to distinguish between legitimate users and human harvesters. 

Have a great strategy in mind? Let's chat!
