<span class="list-group-item-heading"> Understanding and Securing TLS (CS 6501)</span>
<br><i>Instructed by David Evans.</i> 
SSL/TLS is the world’s most important cryptographic protocol, used for every
secure web connection and many other purposes. Every month it seems we hear
about another new major vulnerability in TLS. In this project-focused seminar,
we’ll take a deep dive into understanding how TLS came to be the mess it is,
look into some of the vulnerabilities in detail, and study methods for making
TLS more secure. We will be contributing to an open-source implementation of TLS
using the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) programming language.

<span class="list-group-item-heading">Foundations of Cryptography
(CS 4501-001)</span>
<br>
<i>Instructed by Mohammad
Mahmoody.</i> This is an advanced introduction to foundations of cryptography.
We will discuss how to mathematically formalize and construct the basic tasks in
cryptography such as encryption, authentication. We will also discuss some
rather more advanced and sophisticated tasks such as homomorphic encryption,
code obfuscation, and secure computation. Some of the tools we develop in this
course might even look like magic (e.g. zero-knowledge proofs, "interactive"
proofs that leak no knowledge beyond being convincing). We will approach
cryptography from a “constructive” perspective using rigorous mathematical
proofs. By the end of this course students should be able to analyze the
security aspects of a system from theoretical perspective, come up with
"right" security definitions, and use the primitives (or invent one!) to
satisfy that notion of security. This would involve a “construction”
and a “proof of security”.
