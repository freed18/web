# enrolled
I spend most of my time [working deeply](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) on my [research](/research/) -- here are a few
courses at [Cornell CS](https://www.cs.cornell.edu) I took along the way:

# teaching
Please take a look at the [**repository for remarkable
teaching {{<fa github>}}**](https://github.com/havron/teaching) that I host on
GitHub; therein lie some ideas and philosophies that are (perhaps)
increasingly *rare*, *valuable*, and *meaningful* for world-class teaching.

At [UVA CS](https://www.cs.virginia.edu), I TA'd the following courses:
<ul class="ul-interests fa-ul">
<li>
<i class="fa-li fa fa-university"></i>
CS/ECE 2330: Digital Logic
Design (4 semesters: Fall 2015, Spring 2016, Fall 2016, Spring 2017)
</li>
<li>
<i class="fa-li fa fa-university"></i>
