welcome! this repository is home to the code for my personal website,
<https://havron.xyz>. currently, the site is powered by
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in the
[Go](https://golang.org/) programming language; the actual contents are
automatically deployed via
[S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)+[Cloudfront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), using a [git
hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks). most of the
site's content is composed in
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with the [vim text
editor](http://www.vim.org/). 

if there's anything you'd like to see added,
submit a pull request or [send me an email](mailto:havron@virginia.edu)!
